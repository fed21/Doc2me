[Devise] Could not find devise mapping for path "/".
This may happen for two reasons:

1) You forgot to wrap your route inside the scope block. For example:

  devise_scope :user do

  end

2) You are testing a Devise controller bypassing the router.
   If so, you can explicitly tell Devise which mapping to use:

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                Il team di Doc2me è composto da medici professionisti e qualificati. Un medico di turno sarà sempre a disposizione per visite d'urgenza ,mentre le prenotazioni
                in studio o a domicilio avverranno tramite una notifica automatica al medico che avra la facoltà di confermare o disdire. L'utente riceverà ad ogni prenotazione una email di riepilogo da Doc2me e potrà pagare online tramite PayPal o in contanti al termine della visita al medico stesso. In caso di urgenza , a valle del contatto telefonico con il medico , esso stesso consiglierà al paziente se proseguire eventualmente con una visita a studio o direttamente a domicilio.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                Il team di Doc2me è composto da medici professionisti e qualificati. Un medico di turno sarà sempre a disposizione per visite d'urgenza ,mentre le prenotazioni
                in studio o a domicilio avverranno tramite una notifica automatica al medico che avra la facoltà di confermare o disdire. L'utente riceverà ad ogni prenotazione una email di riepilogo da Doc2me e potrà pagare online tramite PayPal o in contanti al termine della visita al medico stesso. In caso di urgenza , a valle del contatto telefonico con il medico , esso stesso consiglierà al paziente se proseguire eventualmente con una visita a studio o direttamente a domicilio.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                Il team di Doc2me è composto da medici professionisti e qualificati. Un medico di turno sarà sempre a disposizione per visite d'urgenza ,mentre le prenotazioni
                in studio o a domicilio avverranno tramite una notifica automatica al medico che avra la facoltà di confermare o disdire. L'utente riceverà ad ogni prenotazione una email di riepilogo da Doc2me e potrà pagare online tramite PayPal o in contanti al termine della visita al medico stesso. In caso di urgenza , a valle del contatto telefonico con il medico , esso stesso consiglierà al paziente se proseguire eventualmente con una visita a studio o direttamente a domicilio.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                Il team di Doc2me è composto da medici professionisti e qualificati. Un medico di turno sarà sempre a disposizione per visite d'urgenza ,mentre le prenotazioni
                in studio o a domicilio avverranno tramite una notifica automatica al medico che avra la facoltà di confermare o disdire. L'utente riceverà ad ogni prenotazione una email di riepilogo da Doc2me e potrà pagare online tramite PayPal o in contanti al termine della visita al medico stesso. In caso di urgenza , a valle del contatto telefonico con il medico , esso stesso consiglierà al paziente se proseguire eventualmente con una visita a studio o direttamente a domicilio.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                Il team di Doc2me è composto da medici professionisti e qualificati. Un medico di turno sarà sempre a disposizione per visite d'urgenza ,mentre le prenotazioni
                in studio o a domicilio avverranno tramite una notifica automatica al medico che avra la facoltà di confermare o disdire. L'utente riceverà ad ogni prenotazione una email di riepilogo da Doc2me e potrà pagare online tramite PayPal o in contanti al termine della visita al medico stesso. In caso di urgenza , a valle del contatto telefonico con il medico , esso stesso consiglierà al paziente se proseguire eventualmente con una visita a studio o direttamente a domicilio.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

                Doc2me nasce dalla collaborazione fra il Dott.Pignataro ,medico specializzando presso 
                la Sapienza di Roma, e un gruppo di studenti di Ingegneria Informatica della stessa Università.
                La piattaforma è sviluppata con lo scopo di velocizzare il contatto fra medici e pazienti ; si propone di 
                superare le attuali difficoltà di comunicazione  offrendo una grafica intuitiva e chiara e permettendo di creare profili familiari. 
                <br>Doc2me ,rispetto ad altri siti già esistenti, permette anche ad utenti non registrati di entrare in contatto con i nostri professionisti
                tramite la sezione Urgenze. <br> Doc2me è attualmente attiva presso la zona Nord di Roma , pur puntando in futuro ad espandersi verso tutta la città. 
                Lo studio medico associato ,sito in via Oslavia 14, si trova in posizione centrale e facilmente raggiungibile.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Compiled all packs in /Users/federico/Documents/new/progettolinguaggidoc2me/public/packs
[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding

[Webpacker] Compiled all packs in /Users/federico/Documents/new/progettolinguaggidoc2me/public/packs
[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.
